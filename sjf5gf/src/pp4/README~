-I struggled with this assignment (pp3)!
-Everything compiles, but the semantic checking (Node::Check()) doesn't work - I guess my symbol tables were not properly implemented.
-I saw Wei Wang in Office Hours several times.
-I think I understand symbol tables conceptually/intuitively, but implementation is difficult.
